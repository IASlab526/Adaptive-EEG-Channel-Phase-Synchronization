##  Supplementary Data

###  `Supplementary_1.pdf` - EEG Spectral Component Ratio Analysis
- Data from **10 subjects**, divided into **0–20 min (non-fatigue) and 41–60 min (fatigue)**.
- **Power Spectral Density (PSD)** analysis and feature extraction.
- **Theta (𝜃), Alpha (𝛼), and Beta (𝛽) wave characteristics**:
  - Increase in **𝜃/𝛼 ratio** in **frontal and temporal regions** during fatigue.
  - Decrease in **𝛼/𝛽 ratio**, indicating **higher β-wave activity** for sustained alertness.
  - **(𝜃 + 𝛼)/(𝛼 + 𝛽) ratio** changes suggest a balance between **drowsiness and alertness**.

###  `Supplementary_2.pdf` - Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS) Analysis
- **FAS is a subjective fatigue assessment** using **a 10-item questionnaire** (score range: 10–50).
- **Pre- and post-experiment FAS scores**:
  - **Before**: 4 healthy, 5 mildly fatigued, 1 severely fatigued.
  - **After**: 8 subjects reached **severe fatigue**, 2 reached **moderate to severe** levels.
